#### **2. Generator**
- **Definition**: The component of the RAG system that generates text based on retrieved documents and the input query. It is typically a pre-trained language model like **BART** or **T5**.
- **Example**: Once documents are retrieved, the **generator** creates a response based on the context provided by those documents.

#### **3. Fusion**
- **Definition**: The process of combining retrieved documents and the input query before passing them to the generative model. Fusion can occur in the **encoder** or the **decoder** of the generative model.
- **Example**: **Fusion-in-Decoder** is when the retrieved documents are integrated into the decoder part of the model.

#### **4. Dense Retrieval**
- **Definition**: A retrieval method where both the query and documents are transformed into dense vector embeddings, typically using neural networks, and similar vectors are retrieved based on cosine similarity or other metrics.
- **Example**: **DPR** is a popular dense retrieval technique that uses dense embeddings to match queries with relevant documents.

#### **5. Sparse Retrieval**
- **Definition**: A retrieval approach that relies on traditional keyword-based techniques like **BM25**, which ranks documents based on the occurrence of terms.
- **Example**: **BM25** is a sparse retrieval technique used in classic information retrieval systems.

#### **6. BM25**
- **Definition**: A probabilistic retrieval model that ranks documents based on term frequency and document length, widely used in traditional search engines.

- **Example**: **Re-ranking** helps select the most useful passages out of several retrieved ones, improving the final answer quality.

#### **24. Hallucination**
- **Definition**: When a generative model produces information that is not factual or supported by the input data. **Hallucination** can occur in RAG systems if the generator creates answers that do not match the retrieved documents.
- **Example**: A **hallucinated** response might say something like “The moon is made of cheese” despite no relevant documents suggesting it.

#### **25. Coherence**
- **Definition**: The quality of the generated response being logically connected, consistent, and relevant to the query and the retrieved documents.
- **Example**: A **coherent** answer to the question "What is AI?" should logically follow the context of the retrieved information and present accurate, consistent details.
